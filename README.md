I am a reliable and detail-oriented individual with strong organizational skills, dedicated to delivering tasks promptly.

My career journey began in 2007 within the military system, initially as a Fireman, and through perseverance and dedication, I progressed to become a Professional Military Diver in 2012. Since 2017, I have held the position of Specialist Officer within the logistics department, and from 2018 onwards, I have taken on the responsibility of staff training and community resilience in emergency situations.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Manufacturing Engineering from "Petru Maior" University of Tg-Mures. My expertise includes proficiency in Computer-aided Design (CAD), with experience using software such as AutoCAD, Inventor, and CATIA.

Before embarking on my military career, I gained valuable experience in Marketing, working across various sectors including sales, insurance, call center support, and customer service.

Driven by energy and ambition, I thrive on facing new challenges and continuously strive for growth and development.
